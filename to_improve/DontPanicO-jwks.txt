==== Generating jwk claims from scratch with x5c ====
# Until now, generating jwk claims from scratch is possible only with a
# basic format containing; kty, kid, use, n and e.
# A feature to generate a jwk claim containing an x5c with or without
# n and e. In order to do that, we should change the --generate-jwk
# option, to be a choice option and not a bool flag anymore.
# For now, options should be; a basic jwk like we already have now,
# a jwk with x5c but no n and no e and a jwk with x5c, n and e.


==== Read jwk and jwks from files ====
# Until now, jwks can only be generated or they will automatically be
# downloaded from jku or x5u headers in relative attacks.
# We should add an option to read jwk and jwks file and insert them in
# the token header.
