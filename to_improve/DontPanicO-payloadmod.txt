==== Merging --payload and --complex-payload ====
# Until now, changing a claim and a subclaim is done via different options
# Merging them in only one option will improve the tool performances and
# the user expirience



==== Implement subclaims generation ====
# Until now, calling --payload on a non existing claim will result in its
# creation while --complex-payload won't (subclaims can only be changes).
# This can be resolved adding automatic creation of subclaims via
# --complex-payload or manual creation via --add-into.
